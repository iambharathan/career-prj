# ✅ PDF EXTRACTION FIXED!

## What I Just Did:

1. **Downgraded pdfjs-dist to 3.11.174** to match the worker version
2. Previously had version 5.4.624 (mismatch)
3. Now both API and worker are on 3.11.174

## 🧪 Test It Now:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R for hard refresh)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8081/resume-screening`
3. **Upload a PDF resume**
4. Should automatically extract text now! ✅

---

## 📝 What to Expect:

1. Upload PDF → "Extracting text from PDF..."
2. Wait 2-5 seconds
3. Text appears in textarea automatically
4. Click "Analyze Resume"
5. Done!

## ✅ Version Match:

- API: `pdfjs-dist@3.11.174`
- Worker: `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@3.11.174/build/pdf.worker.min.js`
- Status: **MATCHING** ✅

**Try uploading a PDF now and let me know if it works!**
