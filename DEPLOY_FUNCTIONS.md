# 🚀 DEPLOY SUPABASE FUNCTIONS

## The functions have CORS headers but need to be redeployed!

Run these commands to deploy them:

```bash
cd /Users/bharathank/hackethon/ai-ats-resume/Career-Navigator

# Deploy all functions at once
npx supabase functions deploy analyze-resume
npx supabase functions deploy skill-gap-analysis
```

## Or if that doesn't work (permission issues):

Just call OpenAI directly from frontend - I'll implement it now!
